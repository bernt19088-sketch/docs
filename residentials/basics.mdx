Roundproxies residential proxies provide access to a global network of residential IP addresses with advanced targeting capabilities. Our proxies support country, state, and city-level targeting, along with session management for consistent IP addresses.

## Proxy Structure

Our residential proxies follow a standardized format that allows precise geographic targeting and session control:

```
residential.roundproxies.com:5000:client-CLIENT_ID-TARGETING_PARAMS-session-SESSION_ID:PASSWORD
```

### Components Breakdown

| **Port**      | Connection port                       | `5000`                                              |
| **Client ID** | Your unique client identifier         | `client-{YOUR_CLIENT_NAME}`                         |
| **Targeting** | Geographic targeting parameters       | `country-Israel-state-northerndistrict-city-maghar` |
| **Session**   | Session identifier for IP persistence | `session-lw515ejc`                                  |
| **Password**  | Authentication password               | `YOUR_PASSWORD`                                     |

## Geographic Targeting

Keep in mind that you **only** need to have the country parameter for your proxies. Other parameters are optional and can be enabled on-demand. However, the more specific you chose the region the more the chance might be that the region has less proxies.

### Country Targeting

<ResponseField name="country" type="string" required="false">
  Country name of the country you would like to target.
</ResponseField>

Target specific countries by including the country parameter in your proxy credentials:

```
country-{COUNTRY_NAME}
```

**Available countries in examples:**

- Israel
- Hungary
- Germany

### State/Region Targeting

<ResponseField name="state" type="string">
  State name of the state (mathching the country) you would like to target.
</ResponseField>

Narrow down to specific states or regions:

```
state-{STATE_NAME}
```

**Examples:**

- `state-northerndistrict` (Israel)
- `state-pestcounty` (Hungary)
- `state-citystatebremen` (Germany)
- `state-landberlin` (Germany)

### City Targeting

Target specific cities for maximum precision:

```
city-{CITY_NAME}
```

**Examples:**

- `city-maghar` (Israel)
- `city-god` (Hungary)
- `city-bremen` (Germany)
- `city-berlin` (Germany)
