Sessions allow you to maintain the same IP address across multiple requests, which is essential for activities requiring consistent identity.

### Session Format

```
session-{SESSION_ID}
```

The session ID can be any alphanumeric string. Using the same session ID will route your requests through the same IP address.

**Example session IDs:**

- `session-lw515ejc`
- `session-gbyii4th`
- `session-wwmchxfs`
- `session-fnzwtath`
